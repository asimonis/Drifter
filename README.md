# Drifters
This is a collection of R code I use to analyze and map tracks and acoustic events detected from drifting buoys. 

Check out the MapWorksheet for examples of how I've used different pieces of code. 

Acoustic events were defined in Pamguard and saved in "sqlite3" database files. 
GPS information from the drifting buoys is collected from Spot devices.
